Create a mockup of the homepage of an e-commerce site. It should have:
    - A logo on the top-left
    - A shopping cart picture on the top-right
    - A "navbar" (aka multiple elements next to each other in a row)
    - A grid of images and descriptions
    - A copyright section at the bottom of the page
    - And nice CSS styling, of course.  
    - Use what you've learned about divs, grids, and HTML elements to help you with this!
